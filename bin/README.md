Mineblock
=========

Mineblock is an 2D indie dev project, with the aim to provide a randomly generated world that allows you to build whatever you want. It is based off the 3D java game Minecraft developed by Mojang. It is currently in very early alpha development however we ask that you download the game and try it out and give us any feedback you can. The project is developed by Luke Parker with Graphics from Joshua Buss and Sebastian Gallop. If you feel you could contribute towards the project please contact us on the contact us page as we would love input from the community. If you want to design a block that may be added to the game it must be 20 x 20 in size. Send us a link to it and if we like it we will add it to the game.
